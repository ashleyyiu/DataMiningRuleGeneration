I imported itertools' combination function to help me find all the subsets of a certain length from a superset. If using an older Python interpreter, must call itertools from sys.modules['itertools'].combinations(list, value). Otherwise, just calling itertools.combinations(list, value) is fine. I have a settings.py file where I set the minimum support and confidence. In main, I import this file as SETTINGS.

To generate rules, I found all possible subsets from length 1 to the length of the superset minus 1. I started with the consequent having length 1. If the confidence of this candidate rule met the minimum confidence, I would calculate the confidence of when the consequent was of length 2 using the same consequent as before plus every value in the precedent. For example, if ABC->D met the minimum confidence, I then checked AB->CD, AC->BD and BC->AD. If ABC->D did not meet the minimum confidence, I would prune that and move onto ABD->C. This is because of the monotonous property of the a priori algorithm. In the end, I printed all the rules, confidence and lift of each rule.
