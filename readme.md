I imported itertools' combination function to help me find all the subsets of a certain length from a superset. If using an older Python interpreter, must call itertools from sys.modules['itertools'].combinations(list, value). Otherwise, just calling itertools.combinations(list, value) is fine. I have a settings.py file where I set the minimum support and confidence. In main, I import this file as SETTINGS.
